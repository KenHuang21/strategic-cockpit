THE FIX
================================================================================

The NaN% issue was resolved by adding the "probability" field to the 
Polymarket events data in dashboard_data.json:

Before:
  {
    "title": "...",
    "outcome": "No 99%",
    "volume": 64836301.774061
  }

After:
  {
    "title": "...",
    "outcome": "No 99%",
    "probability": 0.99,  ← ADDED THIS FIELD
    "volume": 64836301.774061
  }

The SmartMoneyRadar component renders it as:
  {(event.probability * 100).toFixed(0)}%

This correctly calculates: 0.99 × 100 = 99%
