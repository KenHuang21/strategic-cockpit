## Next Session Priorities

### 🎯 PRIMARY GOAL: Maintain System Health

**What to Do:**
1. **System Verification (Mandatory)**
   - Run 2-3 core verification tests
   - Check for any regressions
   - Verify servers still running
   - Confirm data freshness

2. **Status Check**
   - Review current credential situation
   - Check if user has provided Telegram Chat ID
   - Check if user has configured SMTP credentials

3. **If Credentials Available:**
   - Execute Test #38 (Telegram timing)
   - Execute Test #39 (Email timing)
   - Execute Test #43 (End-to-end workflow)
   - Achieve 100% completion (56/56)

4. **If Credentials NOT Available:**
   - Continue maintenance and verification
   - Ensure system remains stable
   - Document current state
   - Wait for user credential configuration

### 📋 Remaining Work

**Integration Tests (3/56 - 5.4%):**
- Test #38: Telegram notification timing (needs real Chat ID)
- Test #39: Email notification timing (needs SMTP credentials)
- Test #43: End-to-end workflow (needs both above)

**Estimated Time to Complete (with credentials):**
- Test #38: 5-10 minutes
- Test #39: 5-10 minutes
- Test #43: 15-20 minutes
- **Total: 25-40 minutes**

**User Action Required:**
1. Message @userinfobot on Telegram to get Chat ID
2. Configure SMTP credentials in backend/.env:
   ```
   SMTP_USER=your.email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
   ```
3. (Optional) Configure GITHUB_TOKEN for production automation
